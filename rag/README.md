This directory contains the setup for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The RAG system will be connected to a FastAPI application.

## Structure

- `data/`: Directory for storing data files.
- `models/`: Directory for storing machine learning models.
- `scripts/`: Directory for scripts related to data processing and model training.
- `app/`: Directory for the FastAPI application.

## Setup

1. Place your data files in the `data/` directory.
2. Add your machine learning models to the `models/` directory.
3. Use the `scripts/` directory for any preprocessing or training scripts.
4. Develop the FastAPI application in the `app/` directory.

## Usage

Follow the instructions in the respective directories to set up and run the RAG system.
